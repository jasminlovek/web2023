        <h2>About Me</h2>
        Hi there! My name is Jasmin Keith and I am from Elizabethtown, Kentucky. 
        I am a senior at the University of Kentucky where I study Information Communication Technology. 
        I've always loved creating things. Not only that, but I love attention to detail! I was really eager 
        to learn how to bring the designs in my head to life on a webpage. To me, it's a lot of fun. I think
        that that's what people should do for the rest of their lives if they can- find something that they love and find fun.
        Or, at least find some time to pursue that passion. 
        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        The main point of this website is to post the work that I've done and to connect with people.
